        <p>
          Hello and welcome! Today being <time datetime="2025-09-15">15th September 2025</time>, 
          and this page marks the beginning of a student project that reflects the rhythm of university life.  
          Think of it as a little snapshot of my world full of sports, cybersecurity, basketball, 
          music, and the everyday balance between ambition and fun.

        <h2> About the Project</h2>
        <p>
          This assignment focuses on building a clean and functional website using HTML alone. The goal is to understand proper structure, linking between pages, and the importance of accessibility through semantic tags.
        </p>

        <h2> Why Semantics Matter</h2>
        <p>
          Semantic tags give meaning to content instead of just making it look a certain way. They make the site more accessible, easier for screen readers, and clearer  for anyone reading or maintaining the code in the future.

        <h2> Did You Know?</h2>
        <p>
          The very first website ever created in 1991 had no CSS or JavaScript at all. It was made up of only HTML, yet it became the foundation for everything the modern web has grown into today.
