        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>My name is <strong>Deborah Wambui</strong>, a student at <abbr title="United States International University">USIU</abbr>.  
        I enjoy sports such as swimming and basketball, I love music, and I’m passionate about cybersecurity.  
        This project reflects both my academic growth and the personal interests that shape my campus life.</p>

        <h2>Purpose of the Project</h2>
        <p>This assignment is a demonstration of modern <strong>HTML5</strong> skills, focusing on:  
        semantic structure, accessibility, and interactive elements that don’t require extra styling or scripts.  
        It’s about showing that clean, meaningful markup can carry a whole website on its own.</p>

        <h2>History of the Web</h2>
        <p>The web has grown massively since its creation in the early 1990s.  
        From plain text pages to multimedia platforms, each stage has been built on the same foundation: structured HTML.  
        Students like us now use these principles not just for design, but to practice accessibility, usability, and digital responsibility.</p>

        <h2>Quick Facts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML5 introduced native support for audio, video, and responsive images.</li>
          <li>Accessibility is central — screen readers rely on semantic elements to guide users.</li>
          <li>Good structure improves both academic communication and web usability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Use semantic elements to give content meaning.</li>
          <li>Ensure accessibility with alt text, headings, and skip links.</li>
          <li>Demonstrate interactivity with HTML alone (<code>&lt;details&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code>).</li>
        </ol>

          <dt>Accessibility</dt>
          <dd>Designing content so that all users, including those with disabilities, can access it fully.</dd>
