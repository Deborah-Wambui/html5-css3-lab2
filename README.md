Overview
This project is a simple website created using pure HTML and styled with CSS. It demonstrates the use of semantic tags, tables, media integration (audio and video), multiple linked pages, and external styling.

Pages
index.html – Home page with a welcome message, project overview, and semantics section.
about.html – Provides more details about the project and its purpose.
media.html – Contains embedded audio and video for demonstration.
extras.html – Includes a weekly study timetable (Monday–Friday) and progress bars for reading progress and course load.

Styling 
Light Purple background across all pages for a clean look.
Headings styled with deep purple for emphasis.
Navigation menu with icons inside soft, colored boxes.
Subtle shading added to the timetable for better readability.
Progress bars styled in deep purple with shorter lengths for neatness.
Consistent margin and alignment so content lines up neatly with the header.
